## Unlink Explot

```c

#define unlink(P, BK, FD) {                                            
  FD = P->fd;                                                          
  BK = P->bk;                                                          
  FD->bk = BK;                                                         
  BK->fd = FD;                                                         
}

```
#### 1) Control Flow

when free() is called --->  It checks if next chunk is free then it unlink the next chunk from list and merge it .


####  2) Ingredient For exploit 

	buf1 = malloc(50); \\   overflow heap
	buf2 = malloc(100); \\  attacker control heap
	strcpy(buf1,argv[1]);

	free(buf1); \\ Triggers vuln 
	free(buf2); 


####  3) Exploit 

      a) Make second chunk as free (overwrite size of second_chunk to 0 )
      b) place fd,bk in second chunk 

To make second chunk  free:
       The free uses the below function to check if a chunk  it is free :
```C
      #define inuse_bit_at_offset(p, s)   (((mchunkptr) (((char *) (p)) + (s)))->size & PREV_INUSE)
```

hence if size is 0 then it points itself hence it's inuse_bit is 0 hence free() belives it as free !!!!!!!!!!!



####  4) Patch 

     __builtin_expect (FD->bk != P || BK->fd != P, 0)

#### 3) Explot  
 
      a) During free(ptr1) :   set size of ptr1 = 0x09 , ptr1+0x8 (fake ptr2 size) > 8 
          now fastbin index would be -1 and max_fast will be overwritten with ptr1 0x80xxxxx
      b)  During free(ptr2) : set size of real ptr2 to 0x919 ((289 + 2) << 3 = 0x918)
          now areana_key overwritten with ptr2
          
      c) During malloc(size):
            
#### Fastbin method
      
               a) if size < max_fast<-->i.e  ptr2 size feild
                  then set a fake fastbin entry and return some stack area u control 
                  set stack location to size of ptr2
               ii) the fastbin index of returned chunk  is computed if it matches then the chunk is returned
                  which is now stack region hence overwrite eip and pwn it !!!!
      
#### Unsorted chunk  method         
         
               b) if size > max_fast 
               
                  the unsorted bin is searched , the chunks are moved to  respective bins  
                  now unsorted_chunks(av) returns &(av->bins[0])
                  
                  Steps to be done
                     i)   &(av->bins[0])+12 {i.e victim} : &(av->bins[0])+4
                     ii)  &(av->bins[0])+16 {i.e bck}    : &eip+8
                     iii) jmp instruction in &(av->bins[0]) {unsorted_chunks(av)->bk = bck  }
                     iv)  bck->fd = EIP = &(av->bins[0]) // place a shellcode here 
         


## House of mind


####  1) Ingredients:

    One free() of a chunk under the control of the exploiter
    A sufficiently large memory space where the exploiter can write

#### 2) Code flow 

``` c


void public_fREe(Void_t* mem)
{
  mstate ar_ptr;
  mchunkptr p;                          /* chunk corresponding to mem */
  
  p = mem2chunk(mem);

  ar_ptr = arena_for_chunk(p);

  _int_free(ar_ptr, mem);
  (void)mutex_unlock(&ar_ptr->mutex);
}

#define HEAP_MAX_SIZE (1024*1024) /* must be a power of two */

#define heap_for_ptr(ptr) \
 ((heap_info *)((unsigned long)(ptr) & ~(HEAP_MAX_SIZE-1)))

/* check for chunk from non-main arena */
#define chunk_non_main_arena(p) ((p)->size & NON_MAIN_ARENA)

#define arena_for_chunk(ptr) \
 (chunk_non_main_arena(ptr) ? heap_for_ptr(ptr)->ar_ptr : &main_arena)

```

#### 3) Road map  

The arena_for_chunk macro just checks if the NON_MAIN_ARENA flag is set if the flag is not set, then the main_arena pointer is returned, otherwise  the heap_for_ptr just performs a “ptr AND 0xFFF00000” and returns the result. 


 The trick is to make the program allocate more and more memory until a chunk is allocated over 0x08100000 in order to have the heap_info structure “located” at 0x08100000.
 
 Now we control ar_ptr i.e first var in heap_info struct 
 
 If the following conditions on the chunk are met, then the unsorted_chunks code is executed:
 
 
   * The size of the chunk must not be less than av->max_fast
   * The IS_MMAPPED bit of the size cannot be set
   * The overflowed chunk cannot equal av->top
   * The NONCONTIGUOUS_BIT of av->max_fast must be set
   * The PREV_INUSE bit of the nextchunk (chunk + size) must be set
   * The size of nextchunk must be greater than 8
   * The size of nextchunk must be less than av->system_mem
   * The PREV_INUSE bit of the chunk must not be set
   * The nextchunk cannot equal av->top
   * The PREV_INUSE bit of the chunk after nextchunk (nextchunk + nextsize) must be set

If all these conditions are met, then the following piece of code is executed:
```
bck = unsorted_chunks(av);  // bck = &(av-bins[0])
fwd = bck->fd;   [derefrenced once ]
p->bk = bck;         <<<<==== same as unlink !!!
p->fd = fwd;
bck->fd = p;  
fwd->bk = p;    [written once]
```

when free(0x8100000) happens the heap_for_ptr() returns ptr itself (since size is modified by overflow) 
now heap_for_ptr()->ar_ptr makes us control of ar_ptr and let's say we set it 1 chunk addr+8
and place shellcode in p  , fwd->bk (let's say eip) = p (shellcode addr).

## House of Force 

The most expected one and the easiest too :)

#### Ingredients:

  *  The exploiter must be able to overwrite the top chunk (i.e. the overflow must happen in a chunk that allows to overwrite the wilderness
  *  There is a malloc() call with an exploiter-controllable size
  *  There is another malloc() call where data are controlled by the exploiter

#### Exploit 

    1) overflow wilderness chunk and make it's size to 0xffffffff
    2) malloc(len) split the chunk so that wilderness chunk will now point to eip 
    3) malloc(16) now u get eip and overwrite it 
    
    NOTE : while calculating len u have to iadjust it manually  since the len will be 8 byte  alligned  
    
## House of Lore

#### Ingredients:


   * Two chunks are allocated and the first one is overflowable
   * The second chunk is freed
   * Another (potentially more) chunk, bigger than the second one, is allocated
   * A new chunk with the same size of the second one is allocated
   * Another chunk with the same size of the second one is allocated

#### Code flow

``` c


void _int_malloc(mstate av, size_t bytes)
{
checked_request2size(bytes, nb);
  if ((unsigned long)(nb) <= (unsigned long)(av->max_fast)) {
    [...]
  }
    if (in_smallbin_range(nb)) {
    idx = smallbin_index(nb);
    bin = bin_at(av,idx);

    if ( (victim = last(bin)) != bin) {

	     bin->bk = bck ;
	     [...]
	}
}
```
    
#### Exploit 

##### Small bin corruption 
    1) We have one overflowable chunk (i.e chunk_a) , ond chunk_b behind it 
    2) now free chunk_b , now that chunk goes into unsorted bin list
    3) now malloc(large_len)  , now chunk_b moves into small bin 
    4) now corrupt chunk_b  using chunk_a
    5) now malloc(same_len) makes free() to unlink our currupted chunk_b , and trigers vuln 
       * now bin->bk overwriiten with  chunk_b->bk(i.e corrupted with say a stack value)
       * also u have to control 3 values in stack to bypass the hardening 
    6) again malloc(same_len) would return stack value for us to play with !!!!
    
    
####  Large bin corruption 
   1) same until u place large bin from unsorted to large bin , corrupting
   2) but next malloc() is not same size but lesser
        * now it searches corresponding bin , but would fail !  (512 < requested_size < size_in_large_bin )
	* searches next bin , and finds it and trigers the vuln
   3) overwrite the victim->size so that (victim->size -nb = 8 ) && avoid set_foot causing segfault 	
   4) return to user controlled stack location and set the stack_fake_chunk-> size 
      so that set_foot doesen't cause a problem again 
      
## House of spirit

####Ingredients:

	* A stack overflow that allows to overwrite a variable containing a chunk address returned by a malloc() call
	* The aforementioned chunk is freed
	* Another chunk is allocated
	* The attacker can control the content of this last chunk
#### Exploit

	1) overwrite free() parametere with a stack value such that :
		* it's addr-8 i.e size field is in fastbin range
		* it's next chunk->size is set (stack_addr+size == some val)
	2) now malloc would return pointer into stack to pwn it !!
